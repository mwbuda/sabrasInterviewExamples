sabrasInterviewExamples
=======================

example toy application; for interviews

---------------------------
This is a mostly realistic example of an application; created for the purpose of doing technical interviews;
and having the candidate analyse the system and make comments.

It is INTENTIONALLY written with: 
* almost no comments
* a few questionable programming practices/code smells
* confusing algoritmic choices
* at least 1 bug/logic error

None of which are documented here, b/c the candidate needs to try and spot them :D

Good Luck!
